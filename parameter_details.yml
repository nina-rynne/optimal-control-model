# Model Parameters for Climate Optimal Control
# Last updated: March 2025

# === Climate/Physical Variables ===

co2_conc_preind: 280 # Preindustrial CO2 concentration (ppm)
co2_target_2100: 700 # CO2 emissions volume at 2100 to reach 1.5°C target (based on TCRE of 0.45)
clim_temp_init: 1.2 # Initial global temperature anomaly (°C above pre-industrial, at 2020)
# clim_tcre: sampled in experimental_design.R

# === Economic Parameters ===

# econ_dam_pct: sampled in experimental_design.R
# disc_rate: sampled in experimental_design.R
# cost_mitig_unit: sampled in experimental_design.R
# cost_remov_unit: sampled in experimental_design.R

# === Model Configuration ===
# These parameters control model behavior rather than physical properties

exp_mitig: 2 # Mitigation cost exponent
exp_remov: 2 # CDR cost exponent
exp_temp_anom: 2 # Temperature anomaly exponent
trans_cond: 0 # default transversality condition
trans_low: 0 # low value for shooting method transversality
trans_high: 5 # hight value for shooting method transversality
