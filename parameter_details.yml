# Model Parameters for Climate Optimal Control
# Last updated: March 2025

# === Climate/Physical Variables ===

co2_conc_preind: 280 # Preindustrial CO2 concentration (ppm)
co2_target_2100: 700 # CO2 emissions volume at 2100 to reach 1.5°C target (based on TCRE of 0.45)
clim_temp_init: 1.2 # Initial global temperature anomaly (°C above pre-industrial, at 2020)
# clim_tcre: sampled in experimental_design.R

# === Economic Parameters ===

# econ_dam_pct: sampled in experimental_design.R
# disc_rate: sampled in experimental_design.R
# cost_mitig_unit: sampled in experimental_design.R
# cost_remov_unit: sampled in experimental_design.R

# === Model Configuration ===
# These parameters control model behavior rather than physical properties

exp_mitig: 2 # Mitigation cost exponent
exp_remov: 2 # CDR cost exponent
exp_temp_anom: 2 # Temperature anomaly exponent

# === Algorithm Settings ===

time_step: 1 # Time step for model integration (years)
convergence_tolerance: 0.001 # Solution convergence
max_iterations: 1e4 # maximum iterations to run in optimal control solution loop
upd_weight: 0.01 # Forward-backward sweep update weight
trans_cond: 0 # Transversality condition (default = 0, used when no final temp target)
trans_low: 0 # Initial lower transversality bound for shooting method
trans_high: 5 # Initial upper transversality bound for shooting method
