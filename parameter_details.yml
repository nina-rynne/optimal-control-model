# Fixed Model Parameters for Climate Optimal Control
# Last updated: March 2025

# This document contains the model parameters that are not part of the sensitivity
# analysis, but can still be changed if needed.

# === Physical Constants ===
# These parameters are based on established scientific constants

# Initial global temperature anomaly (°C above pre-industrial, at 2020)
temp_init: 1.2
  
# Preindustrial CO2 concentration (ppm)
co2_conc_preind: 280
  
# === Experimental Parameters ===
# These parameters can be adjusted depending on the constraints of the optimal control problem

# CO2 emissions volume at 2100 to reach 1.5°C target (based on TCRE of 0.45)
co2_target_2100: 700

# === Economic Parameters ===
# No fixed economic parameters.
# These are all calculated in experimental_design.R
# These are all part of the latin hypercube sampling and sensitivity analysis

# === Model Configuration ===
# These parameters control model behavior rather than physical properties

# Time step for model integration (years)
time_step: 1
  
# Number of time periods to calculate
# n_periods: 100
  
# Mitigation cost exponent
exp_mitig: 2
  
# CDR cost exponent
exp_remov: 2
  
# Residual climate damage exponent
exp_dam: 2
  
# Forward-backward sweep update weight
upd_weight: 0.01
  
# Transversality condition (default = 0, used when no final temp target)
trans_cond: 0

# Initial lower transversality bound for shooting method
trans_low: 0
  
# Initial upper transversality bound for shooting method
trans_high: 5
